### About the Educational Project "Stories of the Riga Ghetto for Children"

The Holocaust is one of the most painful lessons that the 20th century gave to the world. However, to protect our children and grandchildren from the bloody mistakes of the past, we must share this experience with them as well. But questions arise: how to tell about such a complex and delicate topic so as not to frighten and traumatize children, yet find empathy in them? Give knowledge, but not get lost in numbers? What should the narrative be like for children of different age groups according to their concentration abilities, knowledge, and psychological stability? How should this topic be told to children with special needs? The Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum, which opened its doors to visitors more than 5 years ago, during which time visitors were often younger guests. Summarizing our experience, consulting with educators and psychologists, we have developed a series of specially adapted excursions for children of different age groups, which correspond to their current physical, psycho-emotional and cognitive abilities.
