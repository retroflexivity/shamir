In early 2025, the Ministry of Culture of Latvia granted accreditation to the Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum. The museum had spent two years preparing — organizing its collection, developing a long-term strategy, and studying the practices of other museums and archives. The accreditation committee confirmed that the museum meets the legal requirements. 

The initial accreditation is granted for a maximum term of five years.
