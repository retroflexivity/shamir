On Sunday, July 3, the traditional March of the Living took place in Riga, an event in memory of the victims of the Holocaust in Latvia. The march participants walked through the streets of the former Riga Ghetto, from the old Jewish cemetery on Moscow Forstadt to the intersection of Dzirnavu and Gogol streets, where the choral synagogue stood until July 2, 1941, and was burned down together with the people locked inside in 1941.



Despite the bad weather, about 150 people participated in the march, including Latvian politicians and representatives of the diplomatic corps.
