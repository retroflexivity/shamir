In April 2025, staff from the Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum joined the first official Latvian delegation to the March of the Living, held at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial. This year, 8,500 people from around the world participated in the march to commemorate the 1.1 million victims who perished there. The presence of Holocaust survivors and survivors of the October 7 attacks gave the event a special gravity. For our delegation, it was a deeply meaningful act of remembrance, solidarity, and testimony.
