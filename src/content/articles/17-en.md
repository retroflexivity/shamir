On 17 July 2019, Riga Ghetto and Latvian Holocaust Museum will launch several new exhibitions.
Besides the previously announced exhibition “The Jews of North Africa during the Holocaust”, the Museum will also launch the exhibition “Riga Ghetto in Alexandra Beltsova’s drawings” provided by the Žanis Lipke Memorial Museum, the project “Shtetl, lost but not forgotten world”, with the archive photos and drawings by Vera Bondar and Margarita Zaitseva. In addition, the Museum will exhibit once more the drawings by Feliks Mostovicz and Josef Kuzkovski.

The infrastructure of the Museum is also developing: the exhibitions have been assigned new numbers, the information leaflets have been updated. A kosher café Beker Meister has opened its doors in the territory of the Museum. It offers a tempting opportunity to taste delicious pita breads with falafel and eggplant, spicy sweet lekach and other Jewish and non-Jewish foods.

We invite you to see the new exhibits of the museum! We remind you that the Riga Ghetto and Holocaust Museum is situated at Turgeņeva iela 2, with two entrances from Krasta iela and Maskavas iela. The opening hours are 10 to 18 on weekdays and Sundays. There is no entry fee but the donations are encouraged. As the museum exhibits are being updated, we also made new information leaflets in eight languages: English, Latvian, Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Turkish. They are available via the following links:
